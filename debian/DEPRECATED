This directory contains legacy Debian packaging configuration for the
electrode project. The project now uses a PEP 517 build (`pyproject.toml`)
and pip-based installation is preferred. You can remove or ignore this
directory unless you specifically need to build Debian packages.

Files here are kept for reference only.
